    App that implements a simple command executor with support for pipes (the | operator), similar to how Unix/Linux shells work.
    
    P3
    Custom thread pool for parallel task execution in Python.


lab13 - Functional Programming
    Functional programming is a paradigm where the emphasis is placed on transforming data with expressions (ideally, these expressions should have no side effects).

    P1
    App that demonstrates functional programming in Python using the PyFunctional library (functional.seq).

    P2
    App that uses MapReduce pattern using the more_itertools library to group and sort words by their first letter.

    P3
    App that demonstrates functional programming techniques to process numbers through filtering, pairing, multiplying, and summing.

    P4
    App that implements a state machine (automaton) that processes a list of numbers through a series of filtering transformations.
